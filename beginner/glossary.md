### Hash

A hash is a sequence of letters and numbers that represent a unique piece of content. The hash is much shorter then the entire content, but any change in the content results in a new hash. This allows for an ID to unique pieces of content. Hashes are one-way however and you can't figure out what the content was based on the hash.
